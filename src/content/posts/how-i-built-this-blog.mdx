# How I Built This Blog with Next.js 14 and MDX

Building a personal blog is a rite of passage for many developers. It's a great way to experiment with new technologies and own your content. In this post, I'll share how I built this blog using **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**.

## The Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**: For robust routing and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and a modern look.
- **MDX**: To write content in Markdown with the power of React components.
- **shiki**: For beautiful syntax highlighting.

## Why Next.js App Router?

The App Router represents the future of Next.js. It allows for:
1. **React Server Components (RSC)**: Reducing the client-side JavaScript bundle.
2. **Simplified Data Fetching**: Fetching data directly in your components.
3. **Layouts**: Easily sharing UI between routes (like the header and footer).

## Styling with Tailwind

Tailwind CSS makes it incredibly fast to prototype and build designs. I used `@tailwindcss/typography` to style the markdown content effortlessly without writing custom CSS for every heading and paragraph.

```css
/* tailwind.config.ts */
plugins: [
  require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
],
```

## MDX Integration

I chose `next-mdx-remote` for flexibility. It allows me to store posts as files and render them securely.

Here is a snippet of how I read the posts:

```typescript
export function getPostBySlug(slug: string): Post {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.mdx$/, '');
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${realSlug}.mdx`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
  // ... processing logic
}
```

## Conclusion

This stack provides a perfect balance of performance and developer experience. Stay tuned for more posts!
